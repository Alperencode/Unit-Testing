# Unit Testing Repository - Library-Management-System

This repository serves as a learning resource for unit testing in Python. I'm using it to practice writing unit tests for my personal project, [Library-Management-System](https://github.com/Alperencode/Library-Management-System), which is also on GitHub.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to learn and improve my unit testing skills by writing tests for the Library-Management-System project. By creating and implementing unit tests, I aim to ensure the correctness and reliability of the codebase while gaining hands-on experience with unit testing techniques in Python.
